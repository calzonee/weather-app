# weather-app
In this project I want to get my feet wet with working with APIs and JSON files.

## Description
An API from openweathermap.org will allow to fetch the weather data in a json file. For aesthetic reasons the unsplash API will adjust a background image according to the search term. Using the google maps API will make sure that the user gets the right weather data displayed.

## Technologies
Figma will be used to get a first idea of the design.
